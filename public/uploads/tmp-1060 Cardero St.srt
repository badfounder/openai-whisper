1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
Historically, I'd always thought that the pinnacle of a startup journey was product

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:13,020
market fit. The idea that you could prove that you have something both that, you know,

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,260
meets the needs of a job to be done and some amount of people have in society, and that

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,300
those people are willing to give you a high degree of validation on the usage of it. And

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,980
generally, I would say that means paying money. That's probably not universally true in the

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,980
context of consumer and other things. And I used to believe that sort of if you could

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,900
get product market fit, the rest would sort of work out over time, right? You'd figure

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,180
out a way to scale your operations and your logistics and those kinds of things over time

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,100
and have a great business. And what I realize now is that that's not really true. Most just

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,000
says that do reach product market fit and reach that, you know, fairly material amounts

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,680
of scale, you know, into the tens and hundreds of millions of dollars you can make. Revenue

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,000
still don't clear what seems to be a more important hurdle, right, of being great businesses

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,720
that somehow generate cash in excess of their cost of capital and have some kind of sustaining

14
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,120
differentiating advantage. And so that, you know, thinking even of how difficult a company

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,960
like Slack found it to be at scale where they had, you know, product market fit in

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,560
the sense of, you know, a 10X better experience than maybe their closest competitor in Microsoft

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Teams but were so structurally disadvantaged when it comes to distribution versus Microsoft

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,480
that they really weren't able to, you know, out-earn or outperform as a scale company.

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,840
And so, you know, their tombstone as an independent company was that effectively selling into

20
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:57,600
a more legitimate distribution engine for their business model. And so what does this

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,560
mean? It means that, well, you know, product market fit isn't everything, right? There's

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,000
a second stage of it. And, you know, is it clear who these businesses are that do go

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,640
on to outperform and become real, you know, cash sharing businesses at scale versus ones

24
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,200
that sort of, you know, still grow but maybe languish in terms of being, you know, truly

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:32,200
differentiated cash sharing machines? Is that knowable, you know, early on? Is that part

26
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,000
of the, you know, misreading of the business model or whatnot that sort of a random walk

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,040
of, you know, every 10 companies that sort of get to be on like an early product market

28
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,120
fit? Do they, you know, break out in the right kind of dream to be constrained by some

29
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,440
kinds of gravity? And so I think across all these dimensions, it raises all kinds of interesting

30
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,560
questions, right? And so it makes me think a little bit more about what product market

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,880
fit actually is. And so probably there's not one definition, right? I think most people

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:12,560
think about really having something that seems to make sense, seems to have a narrative go

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,360
to market story around it. And, you know, is easily digestible by the market is something

34
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,840
that solves a problem for them, right? Now, we stop the evidence of that was you're able to sell

35
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,360
that thing for more than what it costs you to make it. And so that's probably true as early

36
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,120
product market fit, right? That may exist as soon as, you know, in an enterprise software company

37
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,800
as soon as you sign your first deal, right? And somebody really puts a little bit of career risk

38
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,360
and some dollars on the line to use your product, it's pretty high signal validation of it being

39
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,480
useful. And there being more of those customers, right? And that signal grows as that, you know,

40
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,680
becomes five and 10, you know, in an ecom, it might be an early fail. But what it doesn't give

41
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,480
you any signal on how big that market, you know, actually is, or how efficient it's going to be to

42
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:16,040
grow. And so what I postulate is that there's a second phase of product market fit, where you as

43
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,760
a company, get your first wave of customers and you get your next wave of customers. And the

44
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:33,360
combination of both meeting a need and being able to explain how you meet that need to the market,

45
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:47,680
but that machine is so effective that you can go to market and achieve returns in some logical way

46
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,000
that are in a chest, right? That's cheaper to grow for you than somebody that has some measurable

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,680
degree of lack of product ownership. And that would feel intuitive to me as an idea.

48
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:12,040
And so how do you start to think about that, right? Is it a better product? Or is it, you know,

49
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,280
a better selection in other parts of your business model and business strategy that you have a

50
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,600
better insight on how distribution or pricing should work in this category and changed in a

51
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,560
way that allows you to grow, right? Have you just been more diligent on your internal engine that,

52
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,240
you know, is operating more efficiently and thus you just do acquire customers more cheaply because

53
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,080
you have a little bit less waste in the system, right? And you've invested more smartly in your

54
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:46,840
automation and things like that. Was it, you know, related to how big or how nascent that market is,

55
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,960
right? To have true like high efficiency growth product market fit generally implies like a

56
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,280
rapidly growing or rapidly emerging market that happens to be a lot of, but it's still quite

57
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,200
a greenfield, right? And it only later shows itself to be large, kind of unknowable. And so

58
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,920
these things are interesting, right? What, you know, what's the perfect definition of the first

59
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,120
product market fit? What's the right definition of this like kind of, you know, efficient growth

60
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,320
product market fit? What are the signals that this is going to be a sustaining outlook turner

61
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,880
long term that, you know, it's a business that kind of can break free of the forces of gravity.

62
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,480
How are we identifying that in advance? And when does the business have to design for that? Is that

63
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,280
on day one, you know, when you're ideating? You know, much later as you've kind of perved out

64
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,920
these different milestones on product market fit. And that's something I'm curious about.
