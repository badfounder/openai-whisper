00:00.000 --> 00:11.320
So in the context of start-up ideas, they're not all crazy people for a number of reasons.

00:11.320 --> 00:16.200
And so it's hard to tell exactly what's going to work, right? If we have sort of ten, you

00:16.200 --> 00:23.680
know, a hundred highly validated ideas, the lottery or the randomness of real life and

00:23.680 --> 00:28.440
contact with the marketplace and whatever, we'll always have these surprising outcomes

00:28.440 --> 00:34.920
in terms of what might work or what not. But at the start, I think there's some like really

00:34.920 --> 00:42.120
interesting ones is you can put on, you know, an idea just on paper that gives you a little

00:42.120 --> 00:51.560
bit higher probability chances succeeding later. So one of the things in my mind is

00:51.560 --> 00:59.600
asking yourself, what's the problem I'm trying to solve? I mean, I think one of the big issues

00:59.600 --> 01:06.760
is, you know, when you start ideating, it's really fun to jump to solutions, sort of like

01:06.760 --> 01:10.960
ideas or technical technology ideas or anything of that type of technology you want to take

01:10.960 --> 01:15.280
to market. You know, hey, I want to have an AI company, something like that. As opposed

01:15.280 --> 01:20.480
to saying, you know what, like, there was this really specific problem that the burdens

01:20.520 --> 01:27.200
of information security compliance on like small enterprises is huge and growing because

01:27.200 --> 01:30.040
it's more and more important on topic and the quality of the tools isn't good enough,

01:30.040 --> 01:35.640
but something like that, right? It's a problem space we can explore. And so, you know,

01:35.640 --> 01:43.200
defining this problem is so important because it's very unlikely that your initial hypothesis

01:43.200 --> 01:50.120
on a solution is useful or something that really is going to mature into a great product

01:50.640 --> 01:58.800
or a business idea. And whereas, if you align around the problem space, it's very possible

01:58.800 --> 02:08.920
for you to go out, understand that problem very deeply and sort of piece together, you

02:08.920 --> 02:13.480
know, I hate to say have the market, you know, tell you what they need, but tell you where

02:13.480 --> 02:17.480
the pain is, right, and use your magic to think about how you might be able to solve

02:17.480 --> 02:23.240
it, right? So I think number one is, you know, the best startup ideas are problem-focused,

02:23.240 --> 02:35.400
not solution-focused, right? Number two, you want to have an idea that is really worth

02:35.400 --> 02:41.080
putting a lot of time in. I think there's a handful of things that you really want to

02:41.080 --> 02:50.600
put a pretty strong checkbox around upfront, right, with very limited information in advance.

02:50.600 --> 02:57.640
And so one of those is, hey, is this, you know, a problem that is valuable to a lot of people,

02:57.640 --> 03:02.040
right? And I think there's two parts to that. One is, hey, is this like, you know, a problem

03:02.040 --> 03:07.320
that people want solved, right? You know, it's the difference between things. There's all kinds

03:07.320 --> 03:11.960
of stated preferences we have as consumers that we, you know, want healthier food or we're trying

03:11.960 --> 03:17.800
to eat healthy, right, but we don't actually. So it kind of, there's a trap there where we feel

03:17.800 --> 03:24.200
like it's a real startup problem and it isn't. I think the second thing is, if it is a real

03:24.200 --> 03:29.320
problem, there's really enough people that care about it that it could ever be a real business.

03:29.320 --> 03:34.920
And so this is something we kind of lie about to ourselves all the time as entrepreneurs or people

03:34.920 --> 03:40.280
that are prosecuting different ideas. It's like, oh yeah, everybody would want this or, you know,

03:40.280 --> 03:47.960
everybody would do this. And then the reality is, the answer is the market's probably quite

03:47.960 --> 03:51.880
a bit smaller than you think, right? You start being very intellectually honest about, you know,

03:51.880 --> 03:58.120
who this really appeals to or what a solution could, you know, who they could appeal to or

03:58.120 --> 04:02.920
who you could distribute to or whatever it might be, right? So in lots of cases that,

04:02.920 --> 04:08.920
you know, you're still bidding early, right? The market for this might not exist yet, but

04:09.720 --> 04:17.880
you'd have to very rationally believe that when it comes to exist that it may be worth

04:17.880 --> 04:24.200
the time and effort invested into this business. I think the second really important filter is,

04:25.800 --> 04:32.040
so you have a problem, is it remotely possible to solve it? And so you might find yourself saying,

04:32.040 --> 04:38.840
you know what, like the cost of energy is a problem. If we could actually create energy

04:38.840 --> 04:44.040
abundance, it would do all kinds of things for different industries and the competitiveness of

04:44.040 --> 04:50.120
Canada or North America or whatever in the world. And that'd be great, but like to what extent can

04:50.120 --> 04:54.920
we, you know, are we positioned as like a founding team to actually, you know, solve that? And I mean

04:54.920 --> 04:58.520
that specifically in like, you know, what about if it's like, well, cold fusion makes plenty of

04:58.520 --> 05:03.960
sense or some, you know, patent on cold fusion at the university that I could license or something,

05:03.960 --> 05:09.720
but like it's very difficult, right? The more tactical risk you take on, you know, generally

05:09.720 --> 05:13.480
you can think of a business that's a product of either technical risk or go to market risk. And

05:13.480 --> 05:17.160
in this case, you know, with that kind of business, you know, of course there would

05:17.160 --> 05:23.160
be a market there if you get some kind of, you know, economic scale cold fusion going.

05:23.800 --> 05:29.240
But that is, you know, you're trading the cost of that for a tremendous amount of like

05:29.240 --> 05:32.120
product and technology risks, like your ability to actually see that.

05:37.560 --> 05:43.080
And so the third thing is slightly different, but might feel like a related idea.

05:45.880 --> 05:52.920
But you should, as a company or as a potential founder or founding team, be able to

05:53.160 --> 06:01.240
have some kind of an answer to why are we, why would we be the people to prosecute this idea,

06:01.240 --> 06:09.400
right? There are all kinds of things that are good ideas and would be good ideas and could surely

06:09.400 --> 06:14.840
make money at scale, but either in the universe of, you know, entrepreneurs that might do it,

06:14.840 --> 06:20.680
that have deep industry connections or experience or some kind of unique edge or insight into this

06:20.680 --> 06:25.160
marketplace are going to be much more likely to succeed than you. But it also may just be

06:25.160 --> 06:31.720
that structurally, you know, there's certain ideas that are better prosecuted by, you know,

06:31.720 --> 06:37.880
a larger organization, right? Or that there's some kind of core resource that's going to be

06:37.880 --> 06:43.480
very hard for you to replicate to take this idea. And it's kind of an easy check to do, right?

06:43.480 --> 06:47.720
Because it's sort of more broadly the idea of founder market fit and that one of the

06:48.680 --> 06:55.160
absolute most important indicators of success is an alignment, not only because you as a founder

06:55.160 --> 07:05.640
need to have edge, but you would also need to have some emotional equity in the ideas,

07:05.640 --> 07:08.280
but you could prosecute it even when things are inevitably

07:09.160 --> 07:12.120
become a pretty miserable experience as part of doing so.

07:18.680 --> 07:28.040
You might think of this as sort of being related to the customer thing, but I think one of the

07:28.040 --> 07:34.120
other really good ones is being super honest with yourself about

07:36.920 --> 07:43.160
how you would go to market with this specific idea is really important, right? And there are

07:44.120 --> 07:48.600
all kinds of things that are a good idea. You could probably get the product market

07:48.600 --> 07:54.760
fit in the sense of making something that people like and ultimately die on the vine of,

07:55.720 --> 08:02.040
you know, fighting for awareness and distribution and customer acquisition to the point of maybe

08:02.040 --> 08:06.360
having negative economics on everything sold or being unprofitable or just having trouble with

08:06.360 --> 08:18.920
scale beyond a certain size. And so this is universally something that affects every business.

08:21.640 --> 08:27.560
And we see it all the time, right? Ultimately, distribution is way more important than that.

08:28.440 --> 08:32.120
Product quality in a lot of markets is something like Slack, which is

08:32.120 --> 08:40.920
maybe a kind of spread, because Teams got dominated by Microsoft Teams because of the

08:40.920 --> 08:47.320
unique advantages Microsoft had on distribution. And so that's something to consider. Open AI is

08:47.320 --> 08:51.880
the same thing. They've given away a material amount of the equity upside in their business

08:51.880 --> 08:57.480
to have this deep partnership with Microsoft solely to take this idea of distribution

08:58.440 --> 09:05.560
risk off of the table for them. They said, hey, you know, Microsoft's the most important,

09:05.560 --> 09:09.000
probably one of the best partners we could have in terms of their ability to, you know, sell this

09:09.000 --> 09:14.200
technology through with, you know, in a high trust way on established vendor relationships with,

09:14.200 --> 09:20.520
you know, every corporate and IT department and no market business in the world. In addition to that,

09:20.520 --> 09:25.320
they have this very unique capability on the supply side. This partner takes some risk and

09:25.560 --> 09:31.000
costs to the cost structure there. And so they've just tied themselves up. You know, in some sense,

09:31.000 --> 09:37.960
that's pretty much, you know, operate as a division. Microsoft would be impossible for

09:37.960 --> 09:45.320
them to fully merge, due to the regulatory regime, but it's, you know, a very interesting sort of

09:45.320 --> 09:53.800
outcome. And so I think one of the other big ideas in choosing an idea or like what makes a good

09:53.800 --> 10:03.880
startup idea is testability and sort of the signal richness of the type of business idea

10:03.880 --> 10:09.160
are super important. So, you know, certain businesses, you know, think of an extreme,

10:09.160 --> 10:14.280
something like, you know, developing a new therapeutic or pharmaceutical type product,

10:14.280 --> 10:20.280
you know, are so slow, right? You have this, you know, multi-year kind of R&D effort. You kind of

10:20.280 --> 10:27.400
have this multi-year regulatory effort and you have this, then you have your kind of, you know,

10:27.400 --> 10:32.200
effort of commercializing, going to market, earning revenue. And so the business is very kind

10:32.200 --> 10:36.280
of low amount of signal over time, right? It's kind of hard to tell if you're succeeding or not.

10:36.280 --> 10:41.160
Whereas if you go down to the kind of small studio business, you can, you know, there might be

10:41.160 --> 10:52.680
something, even if you just think of someone that maybe like buys widgets on, you know,

10:52.680 --> 10:58.840
Alibaba.com and resells them as a brand new product on Amazon, it's so easy and quick to

10:58.840 --> 11:05.240
get to market in the first place that you can gamify or experiment with this product

11:05.240 --> 11:10.120
and really learn a lot, right? You learn what people like, you really can establish a sense

11:10.120 --> 11:17.800
of your unit economics so much earlier. And so I don't mean this in the sense of, you know,

11:17.800 --> 11:21.880
we want to get to these like micro ideas that aren't going to be really big businesses,

11:21.880 --> 11:30.200
but different businesses that might be really big and really good ideas are harder or easier

11:30.200 --> 11:36.520
to recombinate into the series of experiments that you need to do to gain traction and to validate

11:36.520 --> 11:45.560
them further, right? And so if you're at the idea stage and you're just on the whiteboard

11:45.560 --> 11:52.040
doing it, you know, selecting for businesses where you can kind of quickly, sincerely

11:53.560 --> 12:00.920
envision how you might prosecute a series of simple experiments to get high, you know,

12:00.920 --> 12:05.480
high signal very quickly about the demand for this product to get a really, you know,

12:05.480 --> 12:09.480
continuous and strong feedback with about how to shape the product to the high proposition

12:09.480 --> 12:15.720
and better meet the payments as clients. That idea at this stage is in some sense more valuable

12:16.840 --> 12:21.960
and better than one that, you know, might require your work in product development before you really

12:21.960 --> 12:27.800
get meaningful product and feedback from it. And so I think that's an important filter.
