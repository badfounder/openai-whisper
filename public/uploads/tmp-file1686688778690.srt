00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
idea of Lewis, the following Lewis prescription tells us about covalent bonds, and it tells

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,480
us how many electrons are going to be shared. Now, it also tells us something else that's

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,000
very important, and it's through this concept called formal chart. So that's the next thing

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,280
that we need to learn. See, because now I go to another molecule, in this case it's formaldehyde.

00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,880
Okay, C812. Now, now you're moving from...
