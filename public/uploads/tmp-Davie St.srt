1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,320
So in the context of start-up ideas, they're not all crazy people for a number of reasons.

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,200
And so it's hard to tell exactly what's going to work, right? If we have sort of ten, you

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:23,680
know, a hundred highly validated ideas, the lottery or the randomness of real life and

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,440
contact with the marketplace and whatever, we'll always have these surprising outcomes

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,920
in terms of what might work or what not. But at the start, I think there's some like really

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,120
interesting ones is you can put on, you know, an idea just on paper that gives you a little

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:51,560
bit higher probability chances succeeding later. So one of the things in my mind is

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:59,600
asking yourself, what's the problem I'm trying to solve? I mean, I think one of the big issues

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,760
is, you know, when you start ideating, it's really fun to jump to solutions, sort of like

10
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,960
ideas or technical technology ideas or anything of that type of technology you want to take

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,280
to market. You know, hey, I want to have an AI company, something like that. As opposed

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,480
to saying, you know what, like, there was this really specific problem that the burdens

13
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,200
of information security compliance on like small enterprises is huge and growing because

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,040
it's more and more important on topic and the quality of the tools isn't good enough,

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,640
but something like that, right? It's a problem space we can explore. And so, you know,

16
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,200
defining this problem is so important because it's very unlikely that your initial hypothesis

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,120
on a solution is useful or something that really is going to mature into a great product

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,800
or a business idea. And whereas, if you align around the problem space, it's very possible

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:08,920
for you to go out, understand that problem very deeply and sort of piece together, you

20
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,480
know, I hate to say have the market, you know, tell you what they need, but tell you where

21
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,480
the pain is, right, and use your magic to think about how you might be able to solve

22
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,240
it, right? So I think number one is, you know, the best startup ideas are problem-focused,

23
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:35,400
not solution-focused, right? Number two, you want to have an idea that is really worth

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,080
putting a lot of time in. I think there's a handful of things that you really want to

25
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:50,600
put a pretty strong checkbox around upfront, right, with very limited information in advance.

26
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,640
And so one of those is, hey, is this, you know, a problem that is valuable to a lot of people,

27
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,040
right? And I think there's two parts to that. One is, hey, is this like, you know, a problem

28
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,320
that people want solved, right? You know, it's the difference between things. There's all kinds

29
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,960
of stated preferences we have as consumers that we, you know, want healthier food or we're trying

30
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,800
to eat healthy, right, but we don't actually. So it kind of, there's a trap there where we feel

31
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:24,200
like it's a real startup problem and it isn't. I think the second thing is, if it is a real

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,320
problem, there's really enough people that care about it that it could ever be a real business.

33
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,920
And so this is something we kind of lie about to ourselves all the time as entrepreneurs or people

34
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,280
that are prosecuting different ideas. It's like, oh yeah, everybody would want this or, you know,

35
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,960
everybody would do this. And then the reality is, the answer is the market's probably quite

36
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,880
a bit smaller than you think, right? You start being very intellectually honest about, you know,

37
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:58,120
who this really appeals to or what a solution could, you know, who they could appeal to or

38
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,920
who you could distribute to or whatever it might be, right? So in lots of cases that,

39
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,920
you know, you're still bidding early, right? The market for this might not exist yet, but

40
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:17,880
you'd have to very rationally believe that when it comes to exist that it may be worth

41
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,200
the time and effort invested into this business. I think the second really important filter is,

42
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,040
so you have a problem, is it remotely possible to solve it? And so you might find yourself saying,

43
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,840
you know what, like the cost of energy is a problem. If we could actually create energy

44
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,040
abundance, it would do all kinds of things for different industries and the competitiveness of

45
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,120
Canada or North America or whatever in the world. And that'd be great, but like to what extent can

46
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,920
we, you know, are we positioned as like a founding team to actually, you know, solve that? And I mean

47
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,520
that specifically in like, you know, what about if it's like, well, cold fusion makes plenty of

48
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,960
sense or some, you know, patent on cold fusion at the university that I could license or something,

49
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,720
but like it's very difficult, right? The more tactical risk you take on, you know, generally

50
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,480
you can think of a business that's a product of either technical risk or go to market risk. And

51
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,160
in this case, you know, with that kind of business, you know, of course there would

52
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,160
be a market there if you get some kind of, you know, economic scale cold fusion going.

53
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,240
But that is, you know, you're trading the cost of that for a tremendous amount of like

54
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,120
product and technology risks, like your ability to actually see that.

55
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,080
And so the third thing is slightly different, but might feel like a related idea.

56
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,920
But you should, as a company or as a potential founder or founding team, be able to

57
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:01,240
have some kind of an answer to why are we, why would we be the people to prosecute this idea,

58
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:09,400
right? There are all kinds of things that are good ideas and would be good ideas and could surely

59
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,840
make money at scale, but either in the universe of, you know, entrepreneurs that might do it,

60
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,680
that have deep industry connections or experience or some kind of unique edge or insight into this

61
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,160
marketplace are going to be much more likely to succeed than you. But it also may just be

62
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,720
that structurally, you know, there's certain ideas that are better prosecuted by, you know,

63
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,880
a larger organization, right? Or that there's some kind of core resource that's going to be

64
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,480
very hard for you to replicate to take this idea. And it's kind of an easy check to do, right?

65
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,720
Because it's sort of more broadly the idea of founder market fit and that one of the

66
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,160
absolute most important indicators of success is an alignment, not only because you as a founder

67
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:05,640
need to have edge, but you would also need to have some emotional equity in the ideas,

68
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,280
but you could prosecute it even when things are inevitably

69
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,120
become a pretty miserable experience as part of doing so.

70
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:28,040
You might think of this as sort of being related to the customer thing, but I think one of the

71
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:34,120
other really good ones is being super honest with yourself about

72
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:43,160
how you would go to market with this specific idea is really important, right? And there are

73
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,600
all kinds of things that are a good idea. You could probably get the product market

74
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,760
fit in the sense of making something that people like and ultimately die on the vine of,

75
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:02,040
you know, fighting for awareness and distribution and customer acquisition to the point of maybe

76
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,360
having negative economics on everything sold or being unprofitable or just having trouble with

77
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:18,920
scale beyond a certain size. And so this is universally something that affects every business.

78
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,560
And we see it all the time, right? Ultimately, distribution is way more important than that.

79
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,120
Product quality in a lot of markets is something like Slack, which is

80
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:40,920
maybe a kind of spread, because Teams got dominated by Microsoft Teams because of the

81
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:47,320
unique advantages Microsoft had on distribution. And so that's something to consider. Open AI is

82
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,880
the same thing. They've given away a material amount of the equity upside in their business

83
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,480
to have this deep partnership with Microsoft solely to take this idea of distribution

84
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:05,560
risk off of the table for them. They said, hey, you know, Microsoft's the most important,

85
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,000
probably one of the best partners we could have in terms of their ability to, you know, sell this

86
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,200
technology through with, you know, in a high trust way on established vendor relationships with,

87
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,520
you know, every corporate and IT department and no market business in the world. In addition to that,

88
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,320
they have this very unique capability on the supply side. This partner takes some risk and

89
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,000
costs to the cost structure there. And so they've just tied themselves up. You know, in some sense,

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,960
that's pretty much, you know, operate as a division. Microsoft would be impossible for

91
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:45,320
them to fully merge, due to the regulatory regime, but it's, you know, a very interesting sort of

92
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:53,800
outcome. And so I think one of the other big ideas in choosing an idea or like what makes a good

93
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:03,880
startup idea is testability and sort of the signal richness of the type of business idea

94
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,160
are super important. So, you know, certain businesses, you know, think of an extreme,

95
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,280
something like, you know, developing a new therapeutic or pharmaceutical type product,

96
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,280
you know, are so slow, right? You have this, you know, multi-year kind of R&D effort. You kind of

97
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:27,400
have this multi-year regulatory effort and you have this, then you have your kind of, you know,

98
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,200
effort of commercializing, going to market, earning revenue. And so the business is very kind

99
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,280
of low amount of signal over time, right? It's kind of hard to tell if you're succeeding or not.

100
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,160
Whereas if you go down to the kind of small studio business, you can, you know, there might be

101
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:52,680
something, even if you just think of someone that maybe like buys widgets on, you know,

102
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,840
Alibaba.com and resells them as a brand new product on Amazon, it's so easy and quick to

103
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:05,240
get to market in the first place that you can gamify or experiment with this product

104
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,120
and really learn a lot, right? You learn what people like, you really can establish a sense

105
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:17,800
of your unit economics so much earlier. And so I don't mean this in the sense of, you know,

106
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,880
we want to get to these like micro ideas that aren't going to be really big businesses,

107
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:30,200
but different businesses that might be really big and really good ideas are harder or easier

108
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,520
to recombinate into the series of experiments that you need to do to gain traction and to validate

109
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:45,560
them further, right? And so if you're at the idea stage and you're just on the whiteboard

110
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:52,040
doing it, you know, selecting for businesses where you can kind of quickly, sincerely

111
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,920
envision how you might prosecute a series of simple experiments to get high, you know,

112
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,480
high signal very quickly about the demand for this product to get a really, you know,

113
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,480
continuous and strong feedback with about how to shape the product to the high proposition

114
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,720
and better meet the payments as clients. That idea at this stage is in some sense more valuable

115
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,960
and better than one that, you know, might require your work in product development before you really

116
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,800
get meaningful product and feedback from it. And so I think that's an important filter.
