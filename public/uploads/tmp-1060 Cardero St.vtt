00:00.000 --> 00:05.020
Historically, I'd always thought that the pinnacle of a startup journey was product

00:05.020 --> 00:13.020
market fit. The idea that you could prove that you have something both that, you know,

00:13.020 --> 00:18.260
meets the needs of a job to be done and some amount of people have in society, and that

00:18.260 --> 00:23.300
those people are willing to give you a high degree of validation on the usage of it. And

00:23.300 --> 00:26.980
generally, I would say that means paying money. That's probably not universally true in the

00:26.980 --> 00:31.980
context of consumer and other things. And I used to believe that sort of if you could

00:31.980 --> 00:37.900
get product market fit, the rest would sort of work out over time, right? You'd figure

00:37.900 --> 00:43.180
out a way to scale your operations and your logistics and those kinds of things over time

00:43.180 --> 00:48.100
and have a great business. And what I realize now is that that's not really true. Most just

00:48.100 --> 00:54.000
says that do reach product market fit and reach that, you know, fairly material amounts

00:54.000 --> 00:59.680
of scale, you know, into the tens and hundreds of millions of dollars you can make. Revenue

00:59.680 --> 01:06.000
still don't clear what seems to be a more important hurdle, right, of being great businesses

01:06.000 --> 01:13.720
that somehow generate cash in excess of their cost of capital and have some kind of sustaining

01:13.720 --> 01:19.120
differentiating advantage. And so that, you know, thinking even of how difficult a company

01:19.120 --> 01:23.960
like Slack found it to be at scale where they had, you know, product market fit in

01:23.960 --> 01:28.560
the sense of, you know, a 10X better experience than maybe their closest competitor in Microsoft

01:28.560 --> 01:36.560
Teams but were so structurally disadvantaged when it comes to distribution versus Microsoft

01:36.560 --> 01:42.480
that they really weren't able to, you know, out-earn or outperform as a scale company.

01:42.480 --> 01:48.840
And so, you know, their tombstone as an independent company was that effectively selling into

01:48.840 --> 01:57.600
a more legitimate distribution engine for their business model. And so what does this

01:57.600 --> 02:02.560
mean? It means that, well, you know, product market fit isn't everything, right? There's

02:02.560 --> 02:10.000
a second stage of it. And, you know, is it clear who these businesses are that do go

02:10.000 --> 02:16.640
on to outperform and become real, you know, cash sharing businesses at scale versus ones

02:16.640 --> 02:23.200
that sort of, you know, still grow but maybe languish in terms of being, you know, truly

02:23.200 --> 02:32.200
differentiated cash sharing machines? Is that knowable, you know, early on? Is that part

02:32.200 --> 02:39.000
of the, you know, misreading of the business model or whatnot that sort of a random walk

02:39.000 --> 02:44.040
of, you know, every 10 companies that sort of get to be on like an early product market

02:44.040 --> 02:50.120
fit? Do they, you know, break out in the right kind of dream to be constrained by some

02:50.120 --> 02:55.440
kinds of gravity? And so I think across all these dimensions, it raises all kinds of interesting

02:55.440 --> 03:00.560
questions, right? And so it makes me think a little bit more about what product market

03:00.560 --> 03:04.880
fit actually is. And so probably there's not one definition, right? I think most people

03:04.880 --> 03:12.560
think about really having something that seems to make sense, seems to have a narrative go

03:12.600 --> 03:19.360
to market story around it. And, you know, is easily digestible by the market is something

03:19.360 --> 03:23.840
that solves a problem for them, right? Now, we stop the evidence of that was you're able to sell

03:23.840 --> 03:30.360
that thing for more than what it costs you to make it. And so that's probably true as early

03:30.360 --> 03:37.120
product market fit, right? That may exist as soon as, you know, in an enterprise software company

03:37.120 --> 03:40.800
as soon as you sign your first deal, right? And somebody really puts a little bit of career risk

03:40.800 --> 03:46.360
and some dollars on the line to use your product, it's pretty high signal validation of it being

03:46.360 --> 03:51.480
useful. And there being more of those customers, right? And that signal grows as that, you know,

03:51.480 --> 03:58.680
becomes five and 10, you know, in an ecom, it might be an early fail. But what it doesn't give

03:58.680 --> 04:05.480
you any signal on how big that market, you know, actually is, or how efficient it's going to be to

04:05.480 --> 04:16.040
grow. And so what I postulate is that there's a second phase of product market fit, where you as

04:16.040 --> 04:22.760
a company, get your first wave of customers and you get your next wave of customers. And the

04:22.760 --> 04:33.360
combination of both meeting a need and being able to explain how you meet that need to the market,

04:33.360 --> 04:47.680
but that machine is so effective that you can go to market and achieve returns in some logical way

04:47.680 --> 04:54.000
that are in a chest, right? That's cheaper to grow for you than somebody that has some measurable

04:54.000 --> 05:00.680
degree of lack of product ownership. And that would feel intuitive to me as an idea.

05:00.680 --> 05:12.040
And so how do you start to think about that, right? Is it a better product? Or is it, you know,

05:12.040 --> 05:17.280
a better selection in other parts of your business model and business strategy that you have a

05:17.280 --> 05:23.600
better insight on how distribution or pricing should work in this category and changed in a

05:23.600 --> 05:28.560
way that allows you to grow, right? Have you just been more diligent on your internal engine that,

05:29.440 --> 05:34.240
you know, is operating more efficiently and thus you just do acquire customers more cheaply because

05:34.240 --> 05:38.080
you have a little bit less waste in the system, right? And you've invested more smartly in your

05:38.080 --> 05:46.840
automation and things like that. Was it, you know, related to how big or how nascent that market is,

05:46.840 --> 05:51.960
right? To have true like high efficiency growth product market fit generally implies like a

05:51.960 --> 05:56.280
rapidly growing or rapidly emerging market that happens to be a lot of, but it's still quite

05:56.280 --> 06:03.200
a greenfield, right? And it only later shows itself to be large, kind of unknowable. And so

06:03.200 --> 06:09.920
these things are interesting, right? What, you know, what's the perfect definition of the first

06:09.920 --> 06:15.120
product market fit? What's the right definition of this like kind of, you know, efficient growth

06:15.120 --> 06:22.320
product market fit? What are the signals that this is going to be a sustaining outlook turner

06:22.320 --> 06:28.880
long term that, you know, it's a business that kind of can break free of the forces of gravity.

06:28.880 --> 06:35.480
How are we identifying that in advance? And when does the business have to design for that? Is that

06:35.480 --> 06:40.280
on day one, you know, when you're ideating? You know, much later as you've kind of perved out

06:40.280 --> 06:45.920
these different milestones on product market fit. And that's something I'm curious about.
