0	11320	So in the context of start-up ideas, they're not all crazy people for a number of reasons.
11320	16200	And so it's hard to tell exactly what's going to work, right? If we have sort of ten, you
16200	23680	know, a hundred highly validated ideas, the lottery or the randomness of real life and
23680	28440	contact with the marketplace and whatever, we'll always have these surprising outcomes
28440	34920	in terms of what might work or what not. But at the start, I think there's some like really
34920	42120	interesting ones is you can put on, you know, an idea just on paper that gives you a little
42120	51560	bit higher probability chances succeeding later. So one of the things in my mind is
51560	59600	asking yourself, what's the problem I'm trying to solve? I mean, I think one of the big issues
59600	66760	is, you know, when you start ideating, it's really fun to jump to solutions, sort of like
66760	70960	ideas or technical technology ideas or anything of that type of technology you want to take
70960	75280	to market. You know, hey, I want to have an AI company, something like that. As opposed
75280	80480	to saying, you know what, like, there was this really specific problem that the burdens
80520	87200	of information security compliance on like small enterprises is huge and growing because
87200	90040	it's more and more important on topic and the quality of the tools isn't good enough,
90040	95640	but something like that, right? It's a problem space we can explore. And so, you know,
95640	103200	defining this problem is so important because it's very unlikely that your initial hypothesis
103200	110120	on a solution is useful or something that really is going to mature into a great product
110640	118800	or a business idea. And whereas, if you align around the problem space, it's very possible
118800	128920	for you to go out, understand that problem very deeply and sort of piece together, you
128920	133480	know, I hate to say have the market, you know, tell you what they need, but tell you where
133480	137480	the pain is, right, and use your magic to think about how you might be able to solve
137480	143240	it, right? So I think number one is, you know, the best startup ideas are problem-focused,
143240	155400	not solution-focused, right? Number two, you want to have an idea that is really worth
155400	161080	putting a lot of time in. I think there's a handful of things that you really want to
161080	170600	put a pretty strong checkbox around upfront, right, with very limited information in advance.
170600	177640	And so one of those is, hey, is this, you know, a problem that is valuable to a lot of people,
177640	182040	right? And I think there's two parts to that. One is, hey, is this like, you know, a problem
182040	187320	that people want solved, right? You know, it's the difference between things. There's all kinds
187320	191960	of stated preferences we have as consumers that we, you know, want healthier food or we're trying
191960	197800	to eat healthy, right, but we don't actually. So it kind of, there's a trap there where we feel
197800	204200	like it's a real startup problem and it isn't. I think the second thing is, if it is a real
204200	209320	problem, there's really enough people that care about it that it could ever be a real business.
209320	214920	And so this is something we kind of lie about to ourselves all the time as entrepreneurs or people
214920	220280	that are prosecuting different ideas. It's like, oh yeah, everybody would want this or, you know,
220280	227960	everybody would do this. And then the reality is, the answer is the market's probably quite
227960	231880	a bit smaller than you think, right? You start being very intellectually honest about, you know,
231880	238120	who this really appeals to or what a solution could, you know, who they could appeal to or
238120	242920	who you could distribute to or whatever it might be, right? So in lots of cases that,
242920	248920	you know, you're still bidding early, right? The market for this might not exist yet, but
249720	257880	you'd have to very rationally believe that when it comes to exist that it may be worth
257880	264200	the time and effort invested into this business. I think the second really important filter is,
265800	272040	so you have a problem, is it remotely possible to solve it? And so you might find yourself saying,
272040	278840	you know what, like the cost of energy is a problem. If we could actually create energy
278840	284040	abundance, it would do all kinds of things for different industries and the competitiveness of
284040	290120	Canada or North America or whatever in the world. And that'd be great, but like to what extent can
290120	294920	we, you know, are we positioned as like a founding team to actually, you know, solve that? And I mean
294920	298520	that specifically in like, you know, what about if it's like, well, cold fusion makes plenty of
298520	303960	sense or some, you know, patent on cold fusion at the university that I could license or something,
303960	309720	but like it's very difficult, right? The more tactical risk you take on, you know, generally
309720	313480	you can think of a business that's a product of either technical risk or go to market risk. And
313480	317160	in this case, you know, with that kind of business, you know, of course there would
317160	323160	be a market there if you get some kind of, you know, economic scale cold fusion going.
323800	329240	But that is, you know, you're trading the cost of that for a tremendous amount of like
329240	332120	product and technology risks, like your ability to actually see that.
337560	343080	And so the third thing is slightly different, but might feel like a related idea.
345880	352920	But you should, as a company or as a potential founder or founding team, be able to
353160	361240	have some kind of an answer to why are we, why would we be the people to prosecute this idea,
361240	369400	right? There are all kinds of things that are good ideas and would be good ideas and could surely
369400	374840	make money at scale, but either in the universe of, you know, entrepreneurs that might do it,
374840	380680	that have deep industry connections or experience or some kind of unique edge or insight into this
380680	385160	marketplace are going to be much more likely to succeed than you. But it also may just be
385160	391720	that structurally, you know, there's certain ideas that are better prosecuted by, you know,
391720	397880	a larger organization, right? Or that there's some kind of core resource that's going to be
397880	403480	very hard for you to replicate to take this idea. And it's kind of an easy check to do, right?
403480	407720	Because it's sort of more broadly the idea of founder market fit and that one of the
408680	415160	absolute most important indicators of success is an alignment, not only because you as a founder
415160	425640	need to have edge, but you would also need to have some emotional equity in the ideas,
425640	428280	but you could prosecute it even when things are inevitably
429160	432120	become a pretty miserable experience as part of doing so.
438680	448040	You might think of this as sort of being related to the customer thing, but I think one of the
448040	454120	other really good ones is being super honest with yourself about
456920	463160	how you would go to market with this specific idea is really important, right? And there are
464120	468600	all kinds of things that are a good idea. You could probably get the product market
468600	474760	fit in the sense of making something that people like and ultimately die on the vine of,
475720	482040	you know, fighting for awareness and distribution and customer acquisition to the point of maybe
482040	486360	having negative economics on everything sold or being unprofitable or just having trouble with
486360	498920	scale beyond a certain size. And so this is universally something that affects every business.
501640	507560	And we see it all the time, right? Ultimately, distribution is way more important than that.
508440	512120	Product quality in a lot of markets is something like Slack, which is
512120	520920	maybe a kind of spread, because Teams got dominated by Microsoft Teams because of the
520920	527320	unique advantages Microsoft had on distribution. And so that's something to consider. Open AI is
527320	531880	the same thing. They've given away a material amount of the equity upside in their business
531880	537480	to have this deep partnership with Microsoft solely to take this idea of distribution
538440	545560	risk off of the table for them. They said, hey, you know, Microsoft's the most important,
545560	549000	probably one of the best partners we could have in terms of their ability to, you know, sell this
549000	554200	technology through with, you know, in a high trust way on established vendor relationships with,
554200	560520	you know, every corporate and IT department and no market business in the world. In addition to that,
560520	565320	they have this very unique capability on the supply side. This partner takes some risk and
565560	571000	costs to the cost structure there. And so they've just tied themselves up. You know, in some sense,
571000	577960	that's pretty much, you know, operate as a division. Microsoft would be impossible for
577960	585320	them to fully merge, due to the regulatory regime, but it's, you know, a very interesting sort of
585320	593800	outcome. And so I think one of the other big ideas in choosing an idea or like what makes a good
593800	603880	startup idea is testability and sort of the signal richness of the type of business idea
603880	609160	are super important. So, you know, certain businesses, you know, think of an extreme,
609160	614280	something like, you know, developing a new therapeutic or pharmaceutical type product,
614280	620280	you know, are so slow, right? You have this, you know, multi-year kind of R&D effort. You kind of
620280	627400	have this multi-year regulatory effort and you have this, then you have your kind of, you know,
627400	632200	effort of commercializing, going to market, earning revenue. And so the business is very kind
632200	636280	of low amount of signal over time, right? It's kind of hard to tell if you're succeeding or not.
636280	641160	Whereas if you go down to the kind of small studio business, you can, you know, there might be
641160	652680	something, even if you just think of someone that maybe like buys widgets on, you know,
652680	658840	Alibaba.com and resells them as a brand new product on Amazon, it's so easy and quick to
658840	665240	get to market in the first place that you can gamify or experiment with this product
665240	670120	and really learn a lot, right? You learn what people like, you really can establish a sense
670120	677800	of your unit economics so much earlier. And so I don't mean this in the sense of, you know,
677800	681880	we want to get to these like micro ideas that aren't going to be really big businesses,
681880	690200	but different businesses that might be really big and really good ideas are harder or easier
690200	696520	to recombinate into the series of experiments that you need to do to gain traction and to validate
696520	705560	them further, right? And so if you're at the idea stage and you're just on the whiteboard
705560	712040	doing it, you know, selecting for businesses where you can kind of quickly, sincerely
713560	720920	envision how you might prosecute a series of simple experiments to get high, you know,
720920	725480	high signal very quickly about the demand for this product to get a really, you know,
725480	729480	continuous and strong feedback with about how to shape the product to the high proposition
729480	735720	and better meet the payments as clients. That idea at this stage is in some sense more valuable
736840	741960	and better than one that, you know, might require your work in product development before you really
741960	747800	get meaningful product and feedback from it. And so I think that's an important filter.
