0	5020	Historically, I'd always thought that the pinnacle of a startup journey was product
5020	13020	market fit. The idea that you could prove that you have something both that, you know,
13020	18260	meets the needs of a job to be done and some amount of people have in society, and that
18260	23300	those people are willing to give you a high degree of validation on the usage of it. And
23300	26980	generally, I would say that means paying money. That's probably not universally true in the
26980	31980	context of consumer and other things. And I used to believe that sort of if you could
31980	37900	get product market fit, the rest would sort of work out over time, right? You'd figure
37900	43180	out a way to scale your operations and your logistics and those kinds of things over time
43180	48100	and have a great business. And what I realize now is that that's not really true. Most just
48100	54000	says that do reach product market fit and reach that, you know, fairly material amounts
54000	59680	of scale, you know, into the tens and hundreds of millions of dollars you can make. Revenue
59680	66000	still don't clear what seems to be a more important hurdle, right, of being great businesses
66000	73720	that somehow generate cash in excess of their cost of capital and have some kind of sustaining
73720	79120	differentiating advantage. And so that, you know, thinking even of how difficult a company
79120	83960	like Slack found it to be at scale where they had, you know, product market fit in
83960	88560	the sense of, you know, a 10X better experience than maybe their closest competitor in Microsoft
88560	96560	Teams but were so structurally disadvantaged when it comes to distribution versus Microsoft
96560	102480	that they really weren't able to, you know, out-earn or outperform as a scale company.
102480	108840	And so, you know, their tombstone as an independent company was that effectively selling into
108840	117600	a more legitimate distribution engine for their business model. And so what does this
117600	122560	mean? It means that, well, you know, product market fit isn't everything, right? There's
122560	130000	a second stage of it. And, you know, is it clear who these businesses are that do go
130000	136640	on to outperform and become real, you know, cash sharing businesses at scale versus ones
136640	143200	that sort of, you know, still grow but maybe languish in terms of being, you know, truly
143200	152200	differentiated cash sharing machines? Is that knowable, you know, early on? Is that part
152200	159000	of the, you know, misreading of the business model or whatnot that sort of a random walk
159000	164040	of, you know, every 10 companies that sort of get to be on like an early product market
164040	170120	fit? Do they, you know, break out in the right kind of dream to be constrained by some
170120	175440	kinds of gravity? And so I think across all these dimensions, it raises all kinds of interesting
175440	180560	questions, right? And so it makes me think a little bit more about what product market
180560	184880	fit actually is. And so probably there's not one definition, right? I think most people
184880	192560	think about really having something that seems to make sense, seems to have a narrative go
192600	199360	to market story around it. And, you know, is easily digestible by the market is something
199360	203840	that solves a problem for them, right? Now, we stop the evidence of that was you're able to sell
203840	210360	that thing for more than what it costs you to make it. And so that's probably true as early
210360	217120	product market fit, right? That may exist as soon as, you know, in an enterprise software company
217120	220800	as soon as you sign your first deal, right? And somebody really puts a little bit of career risk
220800	226360	and some dollars on the line to use your product, it's pretty high signal validation of it being
226360	231480	useful. And there being more of those customers, right? And that signal grows as that, you know,
231480	238680	becomes five and 10, you know, in an ecom, it might be an early fail. But what it doesn't give
238680	245480	you any signal on how big that market, you know, actually is, or how efficient it's going to be to
245480	256040	grow. And so what I postulate is that there's a second phase of product market fit, where you as
256040	262760	a company, get your first wave of customers and you get your next wave of customers. And the
262760	273360	combination of both meeting a need and being able to explain how you meet that need to the market,
273360	287680	but that machine is so effective that you can go to market and achieve returns in some logical way
287680	294000	that are in a chest, right? That's cheaper to grow for you than somebody that has some measurable
294000	300680	degree of lack of product ownership. And that would feel intuitive to me as an idea.
300680	312040	And so how do you start to think about that, right? Is it a better product? Or is it, you know,
312040	317280	a better selection in other parts of your business model and business strategy that you have a
317280	323600	better insight on how distribution or pricing should work in this category and changed in a
323600	328560	way that allows you to grow, right? Have you just been more diligent on your internal engine that,
329440	334240	you know, is operating more efficiently and thus you just do acquire customers more cheaply because
334240	338080	you have a little bit less waste in the system, right? And you've invested more smartly in your
338080	346840	automation and things like that. Was it, you know, related to how big or how nascent that market is,
346840	351960	right? To have true like high efficiency growth product market fit generally implies like a
351960	356280	rapidly growing or rapidly emerging market that happens to be a lot of, but it's still quite
356280	363200	a greenfield, right? And it only later shows itself to be large, kind of unknowable. And so
363200	369920	these things are interesting, right? What, you know, what's the perfect definition of the first
369920	375120	product market fit? What's the right definition of this like kind of, you know, efficient growth
375120	382320	product market fit? What are the signals that this is going to be a sustaining outlook turner
382320	388880	long term that, you know, it's a business that kind of can break free of the forces of gravity.
388880	395480	How are we identifying that in advance? And when does the business have to design for that? Is that
395480	400280	on day one, you know, when you're ideating? You know, much later as you've kind of perved out
400280	405920	these different milestones on product market fit. And that's something I'm curious about.
